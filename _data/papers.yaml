- abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized, personalized federated
    learning. For centralized personalized federated learning, a penalty that measures
    the deviation from the local model and its average, is often added to the objective
    function. However, in a decentralized setting this penalty is expensive in terms
    of communication costs, so here, a different penalty -- one that is built to respect
    the structure of the underlying computational network -- is used instead. We present
    lower bounds on the communication and local computation costs for this problem
    formulation and we also present provably optimal methods for decentralized personalized
    federated learning. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical
    performance of our methods.

- abstract: Exploiting higher-order derivatives in convex optimization is known at
    least since 1970's. In each iteration higher-order (also called tensor) methods
    minimize a regularized Taylor expansion of the objective function, which leads
    to faster convergence rates if the corresponding higher-order derivative is Lipschitz-continuous.
    Recently a series of lower iteration complexity bounds for such methods were proved,
    and a gap between upper an lower complexity bounds was revealed. Moreover, it
    was shown that such methods can be implementable since the appropriately regularized
    Taylor expansion of a convex function is also convex and, thus, can be minimized
    in polynomial time. Only very recently an algorithm with optimal convergence rate
    1/k(3p+1)/2 was proposed for minimizing convex functions with Lipschitz p-th derivative.
    For convex functions with Lipschitz third derivative, these developments allowed
    to propose a second-order method with convergence rate 1/k5, which is faster than
    the rate 1/k3.5 of existing second-order methods.

- abstract: 'The assumption of bounded sharpness/smoothness, that is bounded maximum
    eigenvalue of the Hessian of the objective function, plays an important role in
    the analysis of optimization algorithms in the non-convex setting. However, recent
    empirical findings have shown that neural networks have unbounded sharpness, even
    worse the sharpness of the obtained solution seems to depend on the used learning
    rate. This finding questions the value of this very commonly used assumption and
    suggests that many theoretical analyses are based on false premises.

    Here, focusing on the case of deep linear networks, i.e., no activation function,
    we present a number of results to characterize the sharpness of global minima.
    First, we lower bound the sharpness in the minima, showing that, while unbounded,
    its minimal value is an increasing function of the number of layers. Then, we
    analyze the effect of L2 regularization, proving that it constrains the weights
    to be "balanced" at the minima, that in turn constraints the possible sharpness
    to a unique value, completely independent of the learning rate used. Finally,
    we show that GD with a specific stepsize converges to a critical point of a L2
    regularized deep linear network from any initialization, because it will only
    visit points in a set with bounded sharpness. We also empirically validate our
    theoretical findings.'

- abstract: This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning approach to better generalize
    heuristic dispatching rules on the Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP). Current
    models on the JSP do not focus on generalization, although, as we show in this
    work, this is key to learning better heuristics on the problem. A well-known technique
    to improve generalization is to learn on increasingly complex instances using
    Curriculum Learning (CL). However, as many works in the literature indicate, this
    technique might suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transferring the learned
    skills between different problem sizes. To address this issue, we introduce a
    novel Adversarial Curriculum Learning (ACL) strategy, which dynamically adjusts
    the difficulty level during the learning process to revisit the worst-performing
    instances. This work also presents a deep learning model to solve the JSP, which
    is equivariant w.r.t. the job definition and size-agnostic. Conducted experiments
    on Taillard's and Demirkol's instances show that the presented approach significantly
    improves the current state-of-the-art models on the JSP. It reduces the average
    optimality gap from 19.35% to 10.46% on Taillard's instances and from 38.43% to
    18.85% on Demirkol's instances. Our implementation is available online.

- abstract: 'Inspired by the recent work FedNL (Safaryan et al, FedNL: Making Newton-Type
    Methods Applicable to Federated Learning), we propose a new communication efficient
    second-order framework for Federated learning, namely FLECS. The proposed method
    reduces the high-memory requirements of FedNL by the usage of an L-SR1 type update
    for the Hessian approximation which is stored on the central server. A low dimensional
    `sketch'' of the Hessian is all that is needed by each device to generate an update,
    so that memory costs as well as number of Hessian-vector products for the agent
    are low. Biased and unbiased compressions are utilized to make communication costs
    also low. Convergence guarantees for FLECS are provided in both the strongly convex,

    convexity. Numerical experiments confirm the practical benefits of this new FLECS

- abstract: 'This paper investigates the problem of regret minimization in linear
    time-varying (LTV) dynamical systems. Due to the simultaneous presence of uncertainty
    and non-stationarity, designing online control algorithms for unknown LTV systems
    remains a challenging task. At a cost of NP-hard offline planning, prior works
    have introduced online convex optimization algorithms, although they suffer from
    nonparametric rate of regret.

    In this paper, we propose the first computationally tractable online algorithm
    with regret guarantees that avoids offline planning over the state linear feedback
    policies. Our algorithm is based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU)
    principle in which we optimistically select the best model in a high confidence
    region. Our algorithm is then more explorative when compared to previous approaches.
    To overcome non-stationarity, we propose either a restarting strategy (R-OFU)
    or a sliding window (SW-OFU) strategy. With proper configuration, our algorithm
    is attains sublinear regret $O(T^{5/6})$. These algorithms utilize data from the
    current phase for tracking variations on the system dynamics. We corroborate our
    theoretical findings with numerical experiments, which highlight the effectiveness
    of our methods. To the best of our knowledge, our study establishes the first
    model-based online algorithm with regret guarantees under LTV dynamical systems.'

    resulting in fast global and local convergence guarantees. In particular, we a)
    prove an $\mathcal O \left( 1/{k^2} \right)$ global rate, which matches the state-of-the-art
    global rate of cubically regularized Newton method of Polyak and Nesterov (2006)

    best-known local rate of second-order methods, and c) our stepsize formula is
    simple, explicit, and does not require solving any subproblem. Our convergence
    proofs hold under affine-invariant assumptions closely related to the notion of
    self-concordance. Finally, our method has competitive performance when compared
    to existing baselines which share the same fast global convergence guarantees.

    is to introduce methods that alleviate this issue. Thus, here we include a preconditioner

  title: Stochastic Gradient Methods with Preconditioned Updates
  type: tpaper
  year: '2022'
- abstract: Collaboration among multiple data-owning entities (e.g., hospitals) can
    accelerate the training process and yield better machine learning models due to
    the availability and diversity of data. However, privacy concerns make it challenging
    to exchange data while preserving confidentiality. Federated Learning (FL) is
    a promising solution that enables collaborative training through exchange of model
    parameters instead of raw data. However, most existing FL solutions work under
    the assumption that participating clients are honest and thus can fail against
    poisoning attacks from malicious parties, whose goal is to deteriorate the global
    model performance. In this work, we propose a robust aggregation rule called Distance-based
    Outlier Suppression (DOS) that is resilient to byzantine failures. The proposed
    method computes the distance between local parameter updates of different clients
    and obtains an outlier score for each client using Copula-based Outlier Detection
    (COPOD). The resulting outlier scores are converted into normalized weights using
    a softmax function, and a weighted average of the local parameters is used for
    updating the global model. DOS aggregation can effectively suppress parameter
    updates from malicious clients without the need for any hyperparameter selection,
    even when the data distributions are heterogeneous. Evaluation on two medical
    imaging datasets (CheXpert and HAM10000) demonstrates the higher robustness of
    DOS method against a variety of poisoning attacks in comparison to other state-of-the-art
    methods.

- abstract: A very large number of communications are typically required to solve
    distributed learning tasks, and this critically limits scalability and convergence
    speed in wireless communications applications. In this paper, we devise a Gradient
    Descent method with Sparsification and Error Correction (GD-SEC) to improve the
    communications efficiency in a general worker-server architecture. Motivated by
    a variety of wireless communications learning scenarios, GD-SEC reduces the number
    of bits per communication from worker to server with no degradation in the order
    of the convergence rate. This enables larger-scale model learning without sacrificing
    convergence or accuracy. At each iteration of GD-SEC, instead of directly transmitting
    the entire gradient vector, each worker computes the difference between its current
    gradient and a linear combination of its previously transmitted gradients, and
    then transmits the sparsified gradient difference to the server. A key feature
    of GD-SEC is that any given component of the gradient difference vector will not
    be transmitted if its magnitude is not sufficiently large. An error correction
    technique is used at each worker to compensate for the error resulting from sparsification.
    We prove that GD-SEC is guaranteed to converge for strongly convex, convex, and
    nonconvex optimization problems with the same order of convergence rate as GD.
    Furthermore, if the objective function is strongly convex, GD-SEC has a fast linear
    convergence rate. Numerical results not only validate the convergence rate of
    GD-SEC but also explore the communication bit savings it provides. Given a target
    accuracy, GD-SEC can significantly reduce the communications load compared to
    the best existing algorithms without slowing down the optimization process.

    been extensively studied in the last decade with the main focus on oracle calls
    complexity. In this paper, besides the oracle complexity, we focus also on iteration
    complexity, and propose a generic approach that, based on optimal first-order
    methods, allows to obtain in a black-box fashion new zeroth-order algorithms for
    non-smooth convex optimization problems. Our approach not only leads to optimal
    oracle complexity, but also allows to obtain iteration complexity similar to first-order
    methods, which, in turn, allows to exploit parallel computations to accelerate
    the convergence of our algorithms. We also elaborate on extensions for stochastic
    optimization problems, saddle-point problems, and distributed optimization.

    method, tailored to deep learning (DL) applications. Since the stochastic nature
    of (sampled) function information in minibatch processing can affect the performance
    of QN methods, three strategies are utilized to overcome this issue. These involve
    a novel progressive trust-region radius update (suitable for stochastic models),
    batched evaluation instead of the entire data set, for selecting gradient batch-size
    and a restart strategy when quasi-Netwon approximation accuracy deteriorates.
    We analyze the convergence properties of our proposed method and provide the required
    theoretical analysis for different components of our algorithm. The numerical
    results illustrate that our proposed methodology with the new adjustments outperforms
    the previous similar methods, and is competitive with the best tuned stochastic
    first-order methods, in cases where large batch-size is required. Finally, we
    empirically show that our method is robust to the choices of hyper-parameters,

- abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has recently seen tremendous progress,
    allowing the design of novel machine learning applications to preserve the privacy
    of the training data. Existing theoretical results in this field mainly focus
    on distributed optimization for minimization problems. This paper is the first
    to study PFL for saddle point problems (which cover a broader class of optimization
    problems), allowing for a more rich class of applications requiring more than
    just solving minimization problems. In this work, we consider a recently proposed
    PFL setting with the mixing objective function, an approach combining the learning
    of a global model together with locally distributed learners. Unlike most previous
    work, which considered only the centralized setting, we work in a more general
    and decentralized setup that allows us to design and analyze more practical and
    federated ways to connect devices to the network. We proposed new algorithms to
    address this problem and provide a theoretical analysis of the smooth (strongly-)convex-(strongly-)concave
    saddle point problems in stochastic and deterministic cases. Numerical experiments
    for bilinear problems and neural networks with adversarial noise demonstrate the
    effectiveness of the proposed methods.

- abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of an Underestimate Sequence (UES),
    which is a natural extension of Nesterov's estimate sequence. Our definition of
    a UES utilizes three sequences, one of which is a lower bound (or under-estimator)
    of the objective function. The question of how to construct an appropriate sequence
    of lower bounds is also addressed, and we present lower bounds for strongly convex
    smooth functions and for strongly convex composite functions, which adhere to
    the UES framework. Further, we propose several first order methods for minimizing
    strongly convex functions in both the smooth and composite cases. The algorithms,
    based on efficiently updating lower bounds on the objective functions, have natural
    stopping conditions, which provides the user with a certificate of optimality.
    Convergence of all algorithms is guaranteed through the UES framework, and we
    show that all presented algorithms converge linearly, with the accelerated variants
    enjoying the optimal linear rate of convergence.

    \ classes to demonstrate the bullwhip effect and the importance of supply chain\

    \ quantities while cooperatively attempting to minimize the network\u2019s total\
    \ cost, although each agent only observes local information. Academic/practical\
    \ relevance: Under some conditions, a base-stock replenishment policy is optimal.\
    \ However, in a decentralized supply chain in which some agents act irrationally,\
    \ there is no known optimal policy for an agent wishing to act optimally. Methodology:\
    \ We propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to play the beer game.\
    \ Our algorithm makes no assumptions about costs or other settings. As with any\
    \ deep RL algorithm, training is computationally intensive, but once trained,\
    \ the algorithm executes in real time. We propose a transfer-learning approach\
    \ so that training performed for one agent can be adapted quickly for other agents\
    \ and settings. Results: When playing with teammates who follow a base-stock policy,\
    \ our algorithm obtains near-optimal order quantities. More important, it performs\
    \ significantly better than a base-stock policy when other agents use a more realistic\
    \ model of human ordering behavior. We observe similar results using a real-world\

    is matrix-free and inverse-free. The proposed method scales well in terms of both

- abstract: We consider the problem of classifying a map using a team of communicating
    robots. It is assumed that all robots have localized visual sensing capabilities
    and can exchange their information with neighboring robots. Using a graph decomposition
    technique, we proposed an offline learning structure that makes every robot capable
    of communicating with and fusing information from its neighbors to plan its next
    move towards the most informative parts of the environment for map classification
    purposes. The main idea is to decompose a given undirected graph into a union
    of directed star graphs and train robots w.r.t a bounded number of star graphs.
    This will significantly reduce the computational cost of offline training and
    makes learning scalable (independent of the number of robots). Our approach is
    particularly useful for fast map classification in large environments using a
    large number of communicating robots. We validate the usefulness of our proposed

- abstract: Data-driven models for predicting dynamic responses of linear and nonlinear
    systems are of great importance due to their wide application from probabilistic
    analysis to inverse problems such as system identification and damage diagnosis.
    In this study, a physics-based recurrent neural network model is designed that
    is able to learn the dynamics of linear and nonlinear multiple degrees of freedom
    systems given a ground motion. The model is able to estimate a complete set of
    responses, including displacement, velocity, acceleration, and internal forces.
    Compared to the most advanced counterparts, this model requires a smaller number
    of trainable variables while the accuracy of predictions is higher for long trajectories.
    In addition, the architecture of the recurrent block is inspired by differential
    equation solver algorithms and it is expected that this approach yields more generalized
    solutions. In the training phase, we propose multiple novel techniques to dramatically
    accelerate the learning process using smaller datasets, such as hardsampling,
    utilization of trajectory loss function, and implementation of a trust-region
    approach. Numerical case studies are conducted to examine the strength of the
    network to learn different nonlinear behaviors. It is shown that the network is
    able to capture different nonlinear behaviors of dynamic systems with very high
    accuracy and with no need for prior information or very large datasets.

    parallel stochastic algorithm (RAPSA). We call the algorithm random parallel because
    it utilizes

    multiple parallel processors to operate on a randomly chosen subset of blocks
    of the feature vector.

    RAPSA is doubly stochastic since each processor utilizes a random set of functions
    to compute

    the stochastic gradient associated with a randomly chosen sets of variable coordinates.
    Algorithms

    that are parallel in either of these dimensions exist, but RAPSA is the first
    attempt at a methodology that is parallel in both the selection of blocks and
    the selection of elements of the training set.

    In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to compute the stochastic

    component associated with a randomly chosen block. The technical contribution
    of this paper is

    to show that this minimally coordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier

- abstract: In this paper we consider large-scale smooth optimization problems with
    multiple linear coupled constraints. Due to the non-separability of the constraints,
    arbitrary random sketching would not be guaranteed to work. Thus, we first investigate
    necessary and sufficient conditions for the sketch sampling to have well-defined
    algorithms. Based on these sampling conditions we developed new sketch descent
    methods for solving general smooth linearly constrained problems, in particular,
    random sketch descent and accelerated random sketch descent methods. From our
    knowledge, this is the first convergence analysis of random sketch descent algorithms
    for optimization problems with multiple non-separable linear constraints. For
    the general case, when the objective function is smooth and non-convex, we prove
    for the non-accelerated variant sublinear rate in expectation for an appropriate
    optimality measure. In the smooth convex case, we derive for both algorithms,
    non-accelerated and accelerated random sketch descent, sublinear convergence rates
    in the expected values of the objective function. Additionally, if the objective
    function satisfies a strong convexity type condition, both algorithms converge
    linearly in expectation. In special cases, where complexity bounds are known for
    some particular sketching algorithms, such as coordinate descent methods for optimization
    problems with a single linear coupled constraint, our theory recovers the best-known
    bounds. We also show that when random sketch is sketching the coordinate directions
    randomly produces better results than the fixed selection rule. Finally, we present
    some numerical examples to illustrate the performances of our new algorithms.

    Data
  type: jpaper
  year: '2020'
- abstract: In this paper, we propose a Distributed Accumulated Newton Conjugate gradiEnt
    (DANCE) method in which sample size is gradually increasing to quickly obtain
    a solution whose empirical loss is under satisfactory statistical accuracy. Our
    proposed method is multistage in which the solution of a stage serves as a warm
    start for the next stage which contains more samples (including the samples in
    the previous stage). The proposed multistage algorithm reduces the number of passes
    over data to achieve the statistical accuracy of the full training set. Moreover,
    our algorithm in nature is easy to be distributed and shares the strong scaling
    property indicating that acceleration is always expected by using more computing
    nodes. Various iteration complexity results regarding descent direction computation,
    communication efficiency and stopping criteria are analyzed under convex setting.
    Our numerical results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms other comparable
    methods for solving learning problems including neural networks.

- abstract: Large quantities of data which contain detailed condition information
    over an extended period of time should be utilized to prioritize infrastructure
    repairs. As the temporal and spatial resolution of monitoring data drastically
    increase by advances in sensing technology, structural health monitoring applications
    reach the thresholds of big data. Deep neural networks are ideally suited to use
    large representative training datasets to learn complex damage features. In the
    previous study of authors, a real-time deep learning platform was developed to
    solve damage detection and localization challenge. The network was trained by
    using simulated structural connection mimicking the real test object with a variety
    of loading cases, damage scenarios, and measurement noise levels for successful
    and robust diagnosis of damage. In this study, the proposed damage diagnosis platform
    is validated by using temporally and spatially dense data collected by Digital
    Image Correlation (DIC) from the specimen. Laboratory testing of the specimen
    with induced damage condition is performed to evaluate the performance and efficiency
    of damage detection and localization approach.

  type: tpaper
  year: '2019'
- abstract: Mathematical platforms that are able to estimate modal characteristics
    from mobile sensors are not much investigated. Mobile sensors collect spatially
    dense data compared to limited spatial density of fixed sensor networks. This
    feature potentially enables to refine the identified natural mode shapes as well
    as more robust estimations of other modal characteristics, e.g., natural frequencies
    and damping ratios. In this paper, highresolution natural mode shape identification
    of a simple-span bridge using mobile data is investigated. A recent methodology
    developed by authors is used to reconstruct a full bridge response matrix from
    mobile data. Matrix completion technique approximates unobserved signals at many
    virtual stationary locations via a convex optimization procedure. This reconstructed
    data is then fed in batches into available output-only system identification algorithms
    to extract modal properties. Mode shape refinement then is performed by superimposing
    identified results of all considered batches. The accuracy of the matrix completion
    for signal reconstruction was shown before, however, the performance of the estimated
    signal for modal identification has not been demonstrated yet. In this study,
    a numerical case study is examined to compare identification results from this
    procedure compared to a conventional sensing network consists of fixed sensors.

- abstract: Discovering the underlying physical behavior of complex systems is a crucial,

    a finite-difference inspired convolutional neural network framework to learn hidden
    partial differential equations from given data and iteratively estimate future
    dynamical behavior. The methodology designs the filter sizes such that they mimic
    the finite difference between the neighboring points. By learning the governing
    equation, the network predicts the future evolution of the solution by using only
    a few trainable parameters. In this paper, we provide numerical results to compare
    the efficiency of the second-order Trust-Region Conjugate Gradient (TRCG) method
    with the first-order ADAM optimizer.

  type: cpaper

- abstract: We propose a planning and perception mechanism for a robot (agent), that
    can only observe the underlying environment partially, in order to solve an image
    classification problem. A three-layer architecture is suggested that consists
    of a meta-layer that decides the intermediate goals, an action-layer that selects
    local actions as the agent navigates towards a goal, and a classification-layer
    that evaluates the reward and makes a prediction. We design and implement these
    layers using deep reinforcement learning. A generalized policy gradient algorithm
    is utilized to learn the parameters of these layers to maximize the expected reward.
    Our proposed methodology is tested on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits,
    which provides us with a level of explainability while interpreting the agent's
    intermediate goals and course of action.

  type: tpaper
  year: '2019'
- abstract: This paper describes an implementation of the L-BFGS method designed to
    deal with two adversarial situations. The first occurs in distributed computing
    environments where some of the computational nodes devoted to the evaluation of
    the function and gradient are unable to return results on time. A similar challenge
    occurs in a multi-batch approach in which the data points used to compute function
    and gradients are purposely changed at each iteration to accelerate the learning
    process. Difficulties arise because L-BFGS employs gradient differences to update
    the Hessian approximations, and when these gradients are computed using different
    data points the updating process can be unstable. This paper shows how to perform
    stable quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting, studies the convergence
    properties for both convex and nonconvex functions, and illustrates the behavior
    of the algorithm in a distributed computing platform on binary classification
    logistic regression and neural network training problems that arise in machine
    learning.

    from their raw partial observations. Agents are allowed to exchange information

    their own beliefs. It is shown how reinforcement learning techniques can be utilized

- abstract: The newsvendor problem is one of the most basic and widely applied inventory
    models. There are numerous extensions of this problem. One important extension
    is the multi-item newsvendor problem, in which the demand of each item may be
    correlated with that of other items. If the joint probability distribution of
    the demand is known, the problem can be solved analytically. However, approximating
    the probability distribution is not easy and is prone to error; therefore, the
    resulting solution to the newsvendor problem may be not optimal. To address this
    issue, we propose an algorithm based on deep learning that optimizes the order
    quantities for all products based on features of the demand data. Our algorithm
    integrates the forecasting and inventory-optimization steps, rather than solving
    them separately as is typically done. The algorithm does not require the knowledge
    of the probability distributions of the demand. Numerical experiments on real-world
    data suggest that our algorithm outperforms other approaches, including data-driven
    and SVM approaches, especially for demands with high volatility.

- abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can provide reliable solutions in
    many settings, practitioners are often wary of the discrepancies between the RL
    solution and their status quo procedures. Therefore, they may be reluctant to
    adapt to the novel way of executing tasks proposed by RL. On the other hand, many
    real-world problems require relatively small adjustments from the status quo policies
    to achieve improved performance. Therefore, we propose a student-teacher RL mechanism
    in which the RL (the ``student'') learns to maximize its reward, subject to a
    constraint that bounds the difference between the RL policy and the ``teacher''
    policy. The teacher can be another RL policy (e.g., trained under a slightly different
    setting), the status quo policy, or any other exogenous policy. We formulate this
    problem using a stochastic optimization model and solve it using a primal-dual
    policy gradient algorithm. We prove that the policy is asymptotically optimal.
    However, a naive implementation suffers from high variance and convergence to
    a stochastic optimal policy. With a few practical adjustments to address these
    issues, our numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method
    in multiple GridWorld scenarios.

- abstract: Low-rank methods for semidefinite programming (SDP) have gained considerable
    popularity, especially in machine learning applications. Their analyses often
    assume the use of determinant-based regularisers, which are rarely implemented,
    due to the run-time cubic in the dimension in conventional implementations of
    the computation of their gradient. We extend the convergence analyses of low-rank
    methods to a wide class of regularisers. Further, we show that the gradient of
    a well-known regulariser can be computed in time linear in the dimension, which
    makes the regularisation practical. Our results are illustrated on the Max-Cut
    SDP relaxation.

- abstract: We propose a novel topic discovery algorithm for unlabeled images based
    on the bag-of-words (BoW) framework. We first extract a dictionary of visual words
    and subsequently for each image compute a visual word occurrence histogram. We
    view these histograms as rows of a large matrix from which we extract sparse principal
    components (PCs). Each PC identifies a sparse combination of visual words which
    co-occur frequently in some images but seldom appear in others. Each sparse PC
    corresponds to a topic, and images whose interference with the PC is high belong
    to that topic, revealing the common parts possessed by the images. We propose
    to solve the associated sparse PCA problems using an Alternating Maximization
    (AM) method, which we modify for purpose of efficiently extracting multiple PCs
    in a deflation scheme. Our approach attacks the maximization problem in sparse
    PCA directly and is scalable to high-dimensional data. Experiments on automatic
    topic discovery and category prediction demonstrate encouraging performance of
    our approach.

- abstract: Damage diagnosis has been a challenging inverse problem in structural
    health monitoring. The main difficulty is characterizing the unknown relation
    between the measurements and damage patterns (i.e., damage indicator selection).
    Such damage indicators would ideally be able to identify the existence, location,
    and severity of damage. Therefore, this procedure requires complex data processing
    algorithms and dense sensor arrays, which brings computational intensity with
    it. To address this limitation, this paper introduces convolutional neural network
    (CNN), which is one of the major breakthroughs in image recognition, to the damage
    detection and localization problem. The CNN technique has the ability to discover
    abstract features and complex classifier boundaries that are able to distinguish
    various attributes of the problem. In this paper, a CNN topology was designed
    to classify simulated damaged and healthy cases and localize the damage when it
    exists. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated through the finite-element
    simulations of undamaged and damaged structural connections. Samples were trained
    by using strain distributions as a consequence of various loads with several different
    crack scenarios. Completely new damage setups were introduced to the model during
    the testing process. Based on the findings of the proposed study, the damage diagnosis
    and localization were achieved with high accuracy, robustness, and computational
    efficiency.

    framework for the distributed environment, CoCoA, that has an efficient communication
    scheme and is applicable to a wide variety of problems in machine learning and
    signal processing. We extend the framework to cover general non-strongly convex
    regularizers, including L1-regularized problems like lasso, sparse logistic regression,
    and elastic net regularization, and show how earlier work can be derived as a
    special case. We provide convergence guarantees for the class of convex regularized
    loss minimization objectives, leveraging a novel approach in handling non-strongly
    convex regularizers and non-smooth loss functions. The resulting framework has
    markedly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, as we illustrate
    with an extensive set of experiments on real distributed datasets.

- abstract: "In this paper we develop an adaptive dual free Stochastic Dual Coordinate\
    \ Ascent (adfSDCA) algorithm for regularized empirical risk minimization problems.\
    \ This is motivated by the recent work on dual free SDCA of Shalev-Shwartz [1].\
    \ The novelty of our approach is that the coordinates to update at each iteration\
    \ are selected non-uniformly from an adaptive probability distribution, and this\
    \ extends the previously mentioned work which only allowed for a uniform selection\
    \ of \u201Cdual\u201D coordinates from a fixed probability distribution. We describe\
    \ an efficient iterative procedure for generating the non-uniform samples, where\
    \ the scheme selects the coordinate with the greatest potential to decrease the\
    \ sub-optimality of the current iterate. We also propose a heuristic variant of\
    \ adfSDCA that is more aggressive than the standard approach. Furthermore, in\
    \ order to utilize multi-core machines we consider a mini-batch adfSDCA algorithm\
    \ and develop complexity results that guarantee the algorithm's convergence. The\
    \ work is concluded with several numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical\
    \ benefits of the proposed approach."

- abstract: This paper proposes innovative anomaly detection technologies for manufacturing
    systems. We combine the event ordering relationship based structuring technique
    and the deep neural networks to develop the structured neural networks for anomaly
    detection. The event ordering relationship based neural network structuring process
    is performed before neural network training process and determines important neuron
    connections and weight initialization. It reduces the complexity of the neural
    networks and can improve anomaly detection accuracy. The structured time delay
    neural network (TDNN) is introduced for anomaly detection via supervised learning.
    To detect anomaly through unsupervised learning, we propose the structured autoencoder.
    The proposed structured neural networks outperform the unstructured neural networks
    in terms of anomaly detection accuracy and can reduce test error by 20%. Compared
    with popular methods such as one-class SVM, decision trees, and distance-based
    algorithms, our structured neural networks can reduce anomaly detection misclassification
    error by as much as 64%.

- abstract: Structures experience large vibrations and stress variations during their
    life cycles. This causes reduction in their load-carrying capacity which is the
    main design criteria for many structures. Therefore, it is important to accurately
    establish the performance of structures after construction that often needs full-field
    strain or stress measurements. Many traditional inspection methods collect strain
    measurements by using wired strain gauges. These strain gauges carry a high installation
    cost and have high power demand. In contrast, this paper introduces a new methodology
    to replace this high cost with utilizing inexpensive data coming from wireless
    sensor networks. The study proposes to collect acceleration responses coming from
    a structure and give them as an input to deep learning framework to estimate the
    stress or strain responses. The obtained stress or strain time series then can
    be used in many applications to better understand the conditions of the structures.
    In this paper, designed deep learning architecture consists of multi-layer neural
    networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The network achieves to learn the
    relationship between input and output by exploiting the temporal dependencies
    of them. In the evaluation of the method, a three-story steel building is simulated
    by using various dynamic wind and earthquake loading scenarios. The acceleration
    time histories under these loading cases are utilized to predict the stress time
    series. The learned architecture is tested on acceleration time series that the
    structure has never experienced.

- abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for solving Vehicle Routing Problem
    (VRP) using deep reinforcement learning. In this approach, we train a single model
    that finds near-optimal solutions for problem instances sampled from a given distribution,
    only by observing the reward signals and following feasibility rules. Our model
    represents a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient
    algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution
    as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train
    for every new problem instance. Our method is faster in both training and inference
    than a recent method that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), with nearly
    identical solution quality. On the more general VRP, our approach outperforms
    classical heuristics on medium-sized instances in both solution quality and computation
    time (after training). Our proposed framework can be applied to variants of the
    VRP such as the stochastic VRP, and has the potential to be applied more generally
    to combinatorial optimization problems.

- abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the optimization algorithm of choice
    in many machine learning applications such as regularized empirical risk minimization
    and training deep neural networks. The classical analysis of convergence of SGD
    is carried out under the assumption that the norm of the stochastic gradient is
    uniformly bounded. While this might hold for some loss functions, it is always
    violated for cases where the objective function is strongly convex. In (Bottou
    et al.,2016) a new analysis of convergence of SGD is performed under the assumption
    that stochastic gradients are bounded with respect to the true gradient norm.
    Here we show that for stochastic problems arising in machine learning such bound
    always holds. Moreover, we propose an alternative convergence analysis of SGD
    with diminishing learning rate regime, which is results in more relaxed conditions
    that those in (Bottou et al.,2016). We then move on the asynchronous parallel
    setting, and prove convergence of the Hogwild! algorithm in the same regime, obtaining
    the first convergence results for this method in the case of diminished learning
    rate.

- abstract: The beer game is a decentralized, multi-agent, cooperative problem that
    can be modeled as a serial supply chain network in which agents cooperatively
    attempt to minimize the total cost of the network even though each agent can only
    observe its own local information. We develop a variant of the Deep Q-Network
    algorithm to solve this problem. Extensive numerical experiment show the effectiveness
    of our algorithm. Unlike most algorithms in literature, our algorithm does not
    have any limits on the parameter values, and it provides good solutions even if
    the agents do not follow a rational policy. The algorithm can be extended to other
    decentralized multi-agent cooperative games with partially observed information,
    which is a common type of situation in supply chain problems.

- abstract: Training deep neural network is a high dimensional and a highly non-convex
    optimization problem. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and it's variations
    are the current state-of-the-art solvers for this task. However, due to non-covexity
    nature of the problem, it was observed that SGD slows down near saddle point.
    Recent empirical work claim that by detecting and escaping saddle point efficiently,
    it's more likely to improve training performance. With this objective, we revisit
    Hessian-free optimization method for deep networks. We also develop its distributed
    variant and demonstrate superior scaling potential to SGD, which allows more efficiently
    utilizing larger computing resources thus enabling large models and faster time
    to obtain desired solution. Furthermore, unlike truncated Newton method (Marten's
    HF) that ignores negative curvature information by using naive conjugate gradient
    method and Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation information - we propose a novel
    algorithm to explore negative curvature direction by solving the sub-problem with
    stabilized bi-conjugate method involving possible indefinite stochastic Hessian
    information. We show that these techniques accelerate the training process for
    both the standard MNIST dataset and also the TIMIT speech recognition problem,
    demonstrating robust performance with upto an order of magnitude larger batch
    sizes. This increased scaling potential is illustrated with near linear speed-up
    on upto 16 CPU nodes for a simple 4-layer network.

- abstract: In multi-echelon inventory systems the performance of a given node is
    affected by events that occur at many other nodes and at many other time periods.
    For example, a supply disruption upstream will have an effect on downstream, customer-facing
    nodes several periods later as the disruption \"cascades\" through the system.
    There is very little research on stock-out prediction in single-echelon systems
    and (to the best of our knowledge) none on multi-echelon systems. However, in
    real the world, it is clear that there is significant interest in techniques for
    this sort of stock-out prediction. Therefore, our research aims to fill this gap
    by using DNN to predict stock-outs in multi-echelon supply chains.

    problems in power systems. On the example of the alternating-current optimal power
    flows (ACOPF), we bound the difference between the current approximate optimal
    cost generated by our algorithm and the optimal cost for a relaxation using the
    most recent data from above by a function of the properties of the instance and
    the rate of change to the instance over time. We also bound the number of floating-point
    operations that need to be performed between two updates in order to guarantee
    the error is bounded from above by a given constant.

  title: Hybrid Methods in Solving Alternating-Current Optimal Power Flows
  type: jpaper
  year: '2017'
- abstract: With the growth of data and necessity for distributed optimization methods,
    solvers that work well on a single machine must be re-designed to leverage distributed
    computation. Recent work in this area has been limited by focusing heavily on
    developing highly specific methods for the distributed environment. These special-purpose
    methods are often unable to fully leverage the competitive performance of their
    well-tuned and customized single machine counterparts. Further, they are unable
    to easily integrate improvements that continue to be made to single machine methods.
    To this end, we present a framework for distributed optimization that both allows
    the flexibility of arbitrary solvers to be used on each (single) machine locally,
    and yet maintains competitive performance against other state-of-the-art special-purpose
    distributed methods. We give strong primal-dual convergence rate guarantees for
    our framework that hold for arbitrary local solvers. We demonstrate the impact
    of local solver selection both theoretically and in an extensive experimental
    comparison. Finally, we provide thorough implementation details for our framework,
    highlighting areas for practical performance gains.

    does not require a storage of past gradients. The linear convergence rate of SARAH
    is proven under strong convexity assumption. We also prove a linear convergence

    SVRG does not possess. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our

    (FDM) to a randomized (R-FDM) and a coordinate-wise random feasible descent method
    (RC-FDM) framework. We show that the famous SDCA algorithm for optimizing the
    SVM dual problem, or the stochastic coordinate descent method for the LASSO problem,
    fits into the framework of RC-FDM. We prove linear convergence for both R-FDM
    and RC-FDM under the weak strong convexity assumption. Moreover, we show that
    the duality gap converges linearly for RC-FDM, which implies that the duality
    gap also converges linearly for SDCA applied to the SVM dual problem.

- abstract: The question of how to parallelize the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
    method has received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we focus
    instead on batch methods that use a sizeable fraction of the training set at each
    iteration to facilitate parallelism, and that employ second-order information.
    In order to improve the learning process, we follow a multi-batch approach in
    which the batch changes at each iteration. This inherently gives the algorithm
    a stochastic flavor that can cause instability in L-BFGS, a popular batch method
    in machine learning. These difficulties arise because L-BFGS employs gradient
    differences to update the Hessian approximations; when these gradients are computed
    using different data points the process can be unstable. This paper shows how
    to perform stable quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting, illustrates
    the behavior of the algorithm in a distributed computing platform, and studies
    its convergence properties for both the convex and nonconvex cases.

- abstract: 'We propose a new algorithm for minimizing regularized empirical loss:
    Stochastic Dual Newton Ascent (SDNA). Our method is dual in nature: in each iteration
    we update a random subset of the dual variables. However, unlike existing methods
    such as stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of utilizing all curvature
    information contained in the examples, which leads to striking improvements in
    both theory and practice - sometimes by orders of magnitude. In the special case
    when an L2-regularizer is used in the primal, the dual problem is a concave quadratic
    maximization problem plus a separable term. In this regime, SDNA in each step
    solves a proximal subproblem involving a random principal submatrix of the Hessian
    of the quadratic function; whence the name of the method. If, in addition, the
    loss functions are quadratic, our method can be interpreted as a novel variant

- abstract: Distributed optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning suffer
    from a communication bottleneck. Reducing communication makes the efficient aggregation
    of partial work from different machines more challenging. In this paper we present
    a novel generalization of the recent communication efficient primal-dual coordinate
    ascent framework (CoCoA). Our framework, CoCoA+, allows for additive combination
    of local updates to the global parameters at each iteration, whereas previous
    schemes only allowed conservative averaging. We give stronger (primal-dual) convergence
    rate guarantees for both CoCoA as well as our new variants, and generalize the
    theory for both methods to also cover non-smooth convex loss functions. We provide
    an extensive experimental comparison on several real-world distributed datasets,
    showing markedly improved performance, especially when scaling up the number of
    machines.

  title: Adding vs. Averaging in Distributed Primal-Dual Optimization
  type: cpaper
  year: '2015'
- abstract: In this work we show that randomized (block) coordinate descent methods
    can be accelerated by parallelization when applied to the problem of minimizing
    the sum of a  smooth convex function and a simple separable convex function. The
    theoretical speedup, as compared to the serial method, and referring to the number
    of iterations needed to approximately solve the problem with high probability,
    is a simple expression depending on the number of parallel processors and a natural
    and easily computable measure of separability of the smooth component of the objective
    function. In the worst case, when no degree of separability is present, there
    may be no speedup; in the best case, when the problem is separable, the speedup
    is equal to the number of processors. Our analysis also works in the mode when
    the number of blocks being updated at each iteration is random, which allows for
    modeling situations with busy or unreliable processors. We show that our algorithm
    is able to solve a LASSO problem involving a matrix with 20 billion nonzeros in
    2 hours on a large memory node with 24 cores.

    We analyze its complexity under the assumption that the smooth part of the objective

    directly influences the complexity. This extends the results in [22] to a distributed
    environment. We first show that partially block separable functions admit an expected
    separable overapproximation (ESO) with respect to a distributed sampling, compute
    the ESO parameters, and then specialize&nbsp; complexity results from recent literature
    that hold under the generic ESO assumption. We describe several approaches to
    distribution and synchronization of the computation across a cluster of multi-core

- abstract: In this paper we develop a randomized block-coordinate descent method
    for minimizing the sum of a smooth and a simple nonsmooth block-separable convex
    function and prove that it obtains an $\epsilon$-accurate solution with probability
    at least $1- ho$ in at most \$O( frac{n}{\epsilon} \log frac{1}{ ho})$ iterations,
    where \$n\$ is the number of blocks. For strongly convex functions the method
    converges linearly. This extends recent results of Nesterov , which cover the
    smooth case, to composite minimization, while at the same time improving the complexity
    by the factor of 4 and removing $\epsilon$ from the logarithmic term. More importantly,
    in contrast with the aforementioned work in which the author achieves the results
    by applying the method to a regularized version of the objective function with
    an unknown scaling factor, we show that this is not necessary, thus achieving
    true iteration complexity bounds. In the smooth case we also allow for arbitrary
    probability vectors and non-Euclidean norms. Finally, we demonstrate numerically
    that the algorithm is able to solve huge-scale $\ell_1$-regularized least squares
    and support vector machine problems with a billion variables.
